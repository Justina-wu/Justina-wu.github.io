## Degree Thesis

- ##### FedCuckoo: Privacy-Preserving Personalized Federated Learning with Dynamic Parameter Selection<br>

  **Jiayi Wu**

  This paper proposes a personalized federated learning method based on cuckoo hashing, which achieves a balance between personalization and privacy protection by dynamically selecting important parameters and storing them in a hash structure. Experimental results show that this method effectively reduces communication costs and privacy leakage risks while improving the performance of personalized models.
