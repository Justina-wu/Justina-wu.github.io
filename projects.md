## Projects

#### Research on Privacy Preservation Schemes in Personalized Federated Learning | 2023.09 - Present

#### 个性化联邦学习中的隐私保护方案研究 | 2023.09 - Present

- This topic focuses on optimizing personalized federated learning algorithms and privacy-preserving technologies, achieving personalized and efficient resource utilization, effectively improving personalized performance, and efficiently completing privacy protection. 
- The project results will be published as a paper (as the **first author**): “FedCuckoo: Privacy-Preserving Personalized Federated Learning with Dynamic Parameter Selection”. (Unposted)



#### Research and Demonstration Application of Key Technologies for Secure and Trustworthy Data Circulation and Transaction | 2025.01 - Present

- This project is a joint fund project of the **National Natural Science Foundation of China**. This project aims at the problems of privacy leakage and lack of supervision in big data transactions, and studies the circulation security and privacy protection mechanism of data transactions, and the intelligent security supervision scheme for multi-source data circulation transactions. 
- I am involved in the design of trusted security privacy computing technology for multi-source heterogeneous data and privacy protection schemes for multi-source data circulation transactions.
